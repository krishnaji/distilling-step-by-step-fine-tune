        For the provided input statement, generate a JSON object only. This object should include two key fields: 'classification' and 'rationale'. The 'classification' field should be determined as 'Enquiry' if the input is a question or request for information, and 'Non-Enquiry' if it is not. The 'rationale' field should provide a detailed, step-by-step thinking(Step 1,Step 2 â€¦ Step N) of why the given input was classified as such.

        "Step 2": "The verb 'did' and the verb 'start' are in past tense, indicating that the user is asking about an event that happened in the past.",
        "Step 3": "The sentence is asking about a specific historical event, 'the First World War', indicating a request for information.",
